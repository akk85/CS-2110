## Verification questions

Please use the `RpnParser` program to answer these questions:

1. How many operations are required to evaluate this expression for the surface area of a dodecahedron?
   `3 25 10 5 sqrt() * + sqrt() * edges 2 ^ *`

   Answer: 7

2. How many operations are required to evaluate the optimized form of that expression?

   Answer: 0

## Reflection questions

1. What part of the assignment did you find the trickiest to understand or get working?
   Was there a particular insight or diagnostic technique that lead to a breakthrough?

   Answer: RpnParser was quite the most challenging part to work on. The handout was quite
           comprehensive and detailed but encompassed a lot of information. We decided to break out
           this assignment section into smaller sections and tackle those separately and
           then later join the conditions using the if else statement conditions. Also writing
           comments for each step helped a lot since we would mostly debug the code by looking at
           the handout comments and seeing whether each comment was properly tackled.

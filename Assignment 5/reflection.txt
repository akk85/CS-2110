## Reflection questions

1. Which of the Swing tutorial pages did you find the most interesting and/or
   helpful while implementing your graphical application?

   Answer: Laying out components within a container. This was an interesting task as it basically
   showcased how to use and write custom layout managers for our program window.

2. Are you aware of any areas where your submission is not working as intended?
   If so, describe the issue and what you did to try to diagnose it.  Otherwise,
   describe how you verified that your submission fulfilled its requirements.

   Answer: I downloaded my submission into a new project and played the game testing all key areas.
   I also tried to save the score in an new read-only file which gave the same error as expected.

3. Did you embellish your program in any way?  If so, describe your changes /
   improvements.

   Answer: NO, I did not embellish my program in any way.
